## Background Story

You know how it goes - my shiny new Windows laptop broke down, and I had to resort to using my trusty old Mac. But here's the problem: the Mac wallpapers just weren't cutting it for me. I needed something more exciting, more dynamic. That's when I stumbled upon a set of wallpapers that blew my mind! They were different versions of the same image, each representing a different time of day. Eureka! I had found the perfect solution!

Naturally, I assumed there would be a built-in option on my Mac to change wallpapers based on the time of day. Turns out, I was wrong. The Mac wasn't up to speed with my creative genius. Undeterred, I scoured the web for applications that could do the job, but they all demanded a hefty fee. As if I was going to shell out my hard-earned cash for that! Then it hit me - I'm a programmer! Why not take matters into my own hands?

## Installation

To embark on this epic wallpaper-changing journey, you'll need a couple of trusty packages by your side:

- `wallpaper`: This package lets you set and get the wallpaper on your computer. Finally, you can unleash your creativity!
- `node-cron`: With this package, you can schedule specific tasks to run at different times of the day. It's like having a personal assistant for your wallpapers.

Oh, and don't forget about the star of the show - the `.plist` file. It's the magic spell that makes everything come to life on your Mac. You'll have to create one and add it to your LaunchAgents.
